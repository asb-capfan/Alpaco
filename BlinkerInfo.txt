Blinker Data Usage

Key  #1: I found the following file - "file.descriptions.txt" which 
explained the Blinker file types.  This file is included below.  It  
explains that some files are used for statistical uses, some are used  
only for open class words, some are the actual verses that were  
connected, and finally some have the connections in them.

Key #2:The file listed in Key #1 also contained an equation that helped 
me  map the connection files to their respective verses. The equation is 
based on  the connection file names, which are named as follows: 
samp##.SentPair# (where the ## is a number 1-25, and the # is a number 
0-9).  The equation given to  calculate the verse that is mapped to a 
connection file is as follows:  

verse number = ((## - 1) * 10) + (# + 1)   ---## and # are defined above--- 

Key #3: Each verse file is in the form: EN.sample.## or FR.sample.## 
(where ## is a number 1-25).  Each file has 10 verses in them, which are 
all  separated by a \n character.  This, paired with the equation given 
above  helped me map the connection file with the proper verse.

Key #4: In the connection files there are 2 columns of numbers.  These  
numbers are indexes for words in the verses, opposite columns are 
translations of each other.  If a word has a null connection, then its 
partner in the  opposite column is a zero.  This information helped me use 
the functions I  already had implemented, to make the code simpler, and to 
transform the  Blinker data into my format. There are some small 
differences, but they are  unavoidable, and insignificant. 

Key #5: The only files needed by my connection tool are the connection 
files and the verse files.  They end in .SentPair# and .sample.## 
respectively.  The other files are used for statistical purposes, and are 
not necessary for  this research project, with the exception of one type.  
If a file ends in  .open, it lists the connections ignoring the 
closed-class words.  This may be  beneficial because there will be many 
repeats of closed class words, and  multiple connections may not be 
necessary. 
	
Key #6: The way I chose to implement my connection tool does not match how  
the Blinker was used.  Because of this, I needed to change the Blinker 
data to  my format.  This can be done by opening a Blinker connection file  
(samp##.SentPair#), and my program will find the verses needed for this  
connection.  Then connections can be saved in my format by giving names 
for  the English verse, French verse, and for the connection file (my 
format).   This is necessary because the connections were made one verse 
at a time, and  the verse files given have 10 verses in them.  My 
application does not work  with just one verse from a longer file, so I 
must save the single verse in  its own file.

file_descriptions.txt

This file is from the blinker data distribution.  More information about  
this data, and the data itself can be found at: 

http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/projects/proteus/blinker/

Files beginning with	are
--------------------	---

EN			the English text of the gold standard
FR			the French text of the gold standard
frq			words in the focus set, by frequency
A			directories for the data of each annotator


Within the A?/ directories, files are named as follows:

part[12] refers to parts 1 and 2 of the gold standard, where part 1 is
verse pairs 1 to 100 and part 2 is verse pairs 101 to 250

.jnorm .lnorm and .rnorm refer to the 3 kinds of link normalizations:
joint, left and right.  "left" generally refers to the English side
and "right" to the French side.  .lnorm means that the links are
normalized so that the weights of the links attached to any word on
the English side sum to less than or equal to 1.  Likewise for .rnorm
and French.  .jnorm means the weights of links on both sides were
normalized to sum to less than or equal to 1.

.open means links involving a closed-class word on either side were
ignored.

.complete means the complete ordered set of links for either part1 or
part2 of the gold standard.  The 2nd column in these files specifies
the verse pair number; the 1st column specifies link weight.

.sub files are subsets of the .complete files, generated for the
purpose of computing inter-annotator agreements rates and their
standard deviations (see the paper).

The files samp*.SentPair?.* contain the links for particular verse
pairs, where the verse pair number = (samp# - 1) * 10 + SentPair# + 1.
