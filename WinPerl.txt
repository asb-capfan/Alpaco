		PERL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS

Step 1: Go to the following website:
"http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Get.plex?id=ActivePerl"

Step 2: Download the programs required for your version of Windows

Step 3: Install this program

Step 4: Download the MSI version of ActivePerl if possible, if the 
installation fails, download the AS Package. (The AS Package has no UNINSTALL
option)

Step 5: Install this program

Step 6: Run an MSDOS window (possible from the start menu)

Step 7: Type cd ..\perl\bin

Step 8: Type perl -v (This will display the version of perl you installed)

Step 9: Type perl -e "use Tk" If you don't get an error, then perl/Tk has 
beeninstalled correctly. If an error occurs you may have to install a version
of Tk. If so, try this website:
"http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Tk/"
At this site, search for Tkversion#.tar.gz. There will be multiple version#'s,
so search for the latest. Then follow the readme file for installation

Step 10: If Tk is installed correctly, try a simple Hello World program. Use a
simple text editor to make a file which says:

		use Tk;
		my $mw = MainWindow->new;
		$mw->title("Hello World");
		$mw->Button(-text,"Press",-command,sub{exit})->pack(side,left,padx,10);
		$mw->Button(-text,"A Button",-command,sub{exit})->pack(side,left,padx,10);
		$mw->Button(-text,"To Exit",-command,sub{exit})->pack(side,left,padx,10);

		MainLoop;

Save this file as hello.pl in the perl\bin directory. At the DOS prompt, in 
the perl\bin directory. Type perl hello.pl. This should display a simple 
window with 3 exit buttons.
