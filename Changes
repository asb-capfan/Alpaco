Changes from alpaco version 0.1
-------------------------------

* Changed the wording of verse to text were relevant.
  (e.g. 'Source verse' changed to 'Source text')
  Also changed wording of verse into sub-section where relevant.
  (e.g. A file is broken down into 'verses', changed to 'sub-sections')

* Changed the options that were called "load ..." to "open ...".
  The terms load and open are synonyms, so we are trying to stay
  consistent by using only one term, which is open.
  (e.g. 'load text files' changed to 'open text files')

* Reorganized the user interface.  Attempted to make the interface
  more compact and user-friendly.

* Renamed the option 'Clear Total Entry' to 'Clear All'.

* Changed the option 'Word Distance' to 'Resize'.

* Changed the terms 'first' and 'second' to 'source' and 'target' respectively.
  The change was made when referring to the parallel texts, and it was done to 
  gain consistency throughout the package.  

* Changed the size of the main window when alpaco opens.  It used to be a short
  wide window.  This has been overridden to make it more proportionate.

* In the line-by-line functionality, added a previous line functionality.  
  There is already a next line button, but previous may be helpful.

* Removed the "open text files" option from the file menu.  This option was 
  not very practical.  It just simulated pressing enter on both entry fields.
  I removed it to make things more compact and uniform.

* Added a 'find file' option to alpaco-helper.

* Added a default splitting rule to alpaco-helper.

* Warned users before saving over pre-existing files in alpaco-helper.

* In both save modes, if a user attempts to save over a file that already 
  exists, have a pop-up that warns them.  If they chose to overwrite, simply
  continue with the save.  If they cancel, allow them to re-enter a new name
  for the existing file.

* Only pack the blinker buttons if a blinker file has been opened.  As soon as
  a blinker file is opened, however, the blinker buttons must stay until a user
  exits.  Removing the buttons if a user opens a different kind of file could
  cause problems if a user does a particular set of steps.  This is much more
  safe, and also convenient for the user.  The buttons are not available if a 
  blinker file hasn't been opened yet.  

* Consistancy issues I found with Alpaco - bell noise on all errors, make sure 
  all errors have messages, make keyboard shortcuts consistant.
